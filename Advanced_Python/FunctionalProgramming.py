# WHAT IS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING?
# It is about separation of concerns as OOP. But, Separate data and functions.
# Instead of combining methods and attributes, we separate them apart.
# Functions use lists, dictionaries instead of Class(Objects)
# Packaging our codes to make it well-organized.
# Objectives:
# Clear + Understandable Codes, Easy to Extend, Easy to Maintain, Memory Efficient, DRY
# One Pillar ==> Pure Functions
